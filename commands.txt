Welcome to DeepSpeech’s documentation!
DeepSpeech is an open source Speech-To-Text engine, using a model trained by machine learning techniques based on Baidu’s Deep Speech research paper. Project DeepSpeech uses Google’s TensorFlow to make the implementation easier.

To install and use DeepSpeech all you have to do is:

# Create and activate a virtualenv
virtualenv -p python3 $HOME/tmp/deepspeech-venv/
source $HOME/tmp/deepspeech-venv/bin/activate

# in git bash 
# so to activate virtualenv in Git Bash first navigate to your project folder, use ls to list the contents of the folder and be sure you see "Scripts". Change directory to "Scripts" using, once you're in the "Scripts" path, use . activate to activate virtualenv. Don't forget the space after the dot.
